# ump.ai Demo Script: Co-Founder Conflict

## Setup
**Scenario:** Nate (CEO) and Mark (CTO) are arguing about whether to pivot the product after a failed launch. Tension has been building for weeks.

**Duration:** ~60 seconds of dialogue + AI interjections

---

## The Script

### ACT 1: Opening Tension (0:00 - 0:20)

**NATE:** Mark, we need to talk about the pivot. The board wants a decision by Friday and you've been dodging this conversation for two weeks.

**MARK:** I'm not dodging anything. I'm trying to keep us from making another knee-jerk decision. You know, like the last three "pivots" that burned six months of runway.

**NATE:** That's not fair. Those were collective decisions—

**MARK:** *(interrupting)* Were they? Because I remember saying we weren't ready, and you pushed it through anyway because you'd already promised the investors.

---

### ACT 2: Escalation (0:20 - 0:40)

**NATE:** Oh, here we go. Everything's my fault. You know what, Mark? Maybe if the product actually worked on launch day, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

**MARK:** Wow. The product didn't work because you kept changing the scope every week! My team was building to a moving target while you were out doing podcast interviews.

**NATE:** Someone has to be the face of this company! You think investors write checks to people who hide in a basement writing code?

**MARK:** I think investors write checks expecting the product to actually exist!

---

### 🚨 **[UMP.AI INTERJECTION POINT #1]** 

> **UMP:** "I'm hearing frustration from both of you. Let's pause. Nate, Mark—what's the one thing you each need to feel heard right now?"

---

### ACT 3: The Real Issue Surfaces (0:40 - 0:55)

**MARK:** *(sighing)* Fine. You want to know what I need? I need you to stop making promises to investors without talking to me first. I'm supposed to be your partner, not your contractor.

**NATE:** And I need you to actually be in the room when those conversations happen instead of saying you're "too busy with the build."

**MARK:** I'm too busy because you keep—

**NATE:** *(interrupting)* See, this is exactly what I'm talking about—

---

### 🚨 **[UMP.AI INTERJECTION POINT #2]**

> **UMP:** "You're both circling back to blame. Mark, you said you want to be consulted. Nate, you want Mark present. Those sound compatible. Can we focus there?"

---

### ACT 4: Resolution Opening (0:55 - 1:05)

**MARK:** *(pause)* ...Okay. Yeah. That's fair.

**NATE:** Look, I don't want to fight. I just— I need to know you're actually in this with me.

**MARK:** I'm in this. I've always been in this. I just need you to trust my judgment on the technical side.

**NATE:** I do trust you. I'm just scared, man. We're running out of time.

---

### 🚨 **[UMP.AI CLOSING]**

> **UMP:** "That's real progress. You've identified a communication gap, not a values gap. Want me to summarize what you've both committed to?"

## Trigger Analysis (What Ump Detects)

| Trigger | Line | Detection Method |
|---------|------|------------------|
| **Interruption** | Mark cuts off Nate ("Were they?") | VAD overlap detection |
| **Blame language** | "my fault", "your fault" | Keyword + sentiment |
| **Escalation** | Raised voices, faster speech | Audio energy analysis |
| **Personal attack** | "hide in a basement" | Sentiment classifier |
| **Circular argument** | Both repeat same points | Semantic similarity |
| **Defensiveness** | "That's not fair" | Sentiment + pattern |

## Alternative Shorter Version (45 seconds)

If you need tighter timing, cut Act 1 and start mid-conflict:

**MARK:** Those were collective decisions? Because I remember saying we weren't ready, and you pushed it through because you'd already promised investors.

**NATE:** Maybe if the product actually worked on launch day, we wouldn't need a pivot.

**MARK:** The product didn't work because you kept changing scope! My team built to a moving target while you did podcast interviews.

**NATE:** Someone has to be the face of this company!

**MARK:** I think investors expect the product to actually exist!

> **UMP:** "I'm hearing frustration from both of you. Nate, Mark—what do you each need to feel heard right now?"

**MARK:** I need you to stop making promises without talking to me. I'm your partner, not your contractor.

**NATE:** I need you in the room when those conversations happen.

> **UMP:** "Those sound compatible. Mark wants consultation, Nate wants presence. Can we focus there?"

**NATE:** ...Yeah. That's fair. I don't want to fight. I'm just scared we're running out of time.

**MARK:** I'm scared too. But I'm in this.

> **UMP:** "Real progress. You've found a communication gap, not a values gap."

## Demo Tips

1. **Have actors speak naturally** — Don't over-dramatize; real founder fights are more frustrated than theatrical

2. **Let the AI timing feel organic** — Interjections should come 1-2 seconds after a clear trigger, not instantly

3. **Show the detection** — If demoing to investors, briefly flash what Ump detected (tension score, trigger type)

4. **End on hope** — The resolution moment shows Ump's value isn't just interrupting, it's unlocking progress
